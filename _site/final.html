    <p>OK, I’ve rethought your final project.</p>
    <p>I just want you to make something you’re proud of. Then, publish it on the internet. Then, present it to the class. You just have to be excited about the topic you pick.</p>
    <p>It would make my day if …</p>
    <ul>
    <li>… you used javascript.</li>
    <li>… you used some skills that we have not discussed in class (i.e. you learned some on your own).</li>
    <li>… you had fun doing it.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>By tomorrow night, please email me a pitch about what you want to do. I’ll give you some feedback, and you’ll be on your way. It can be something like …</p>

    <p>Hi Larry, I want to do my final project on Scottish people accused of witchcraft. I found a database of more than 3,000 accused <a href="http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches/">witches in Scotland</a> and I want to show all 3,000 of them on a website. I’ve been interested in Scottish witchcraft for a very long time.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I wrote a long story for another class and I’d like to turn that into an interactive experience on the internet. I plan on adding photos that I took and adding a few interactive elements to keep readers engaged.</p>

    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I want to create a site that elegantly displays poems that I love, kind of likes <a href="http://100daysoffonts.com/">this</a>, but with poetry.</p>

    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I want to create a rube goldberg machine with web forms that uses javascript to fire events when other events finish. Kind of like <a href="http://sebastianlyserena.dk/">this</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I’ve really wanted to start up a blog about my experience as a student in New York City. I’ll create a Tumblr blog where all of this can live and hook make it a Tumblr theme so I can actually use it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I want to create a quiz that asks users what color “blue” they’re looking at, based on the “blues” that different brands use. It’d work like <a href="http://namethatblue.com/">this</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I’m really interested in the environment, specifically the drought in California. The state has said they want to cut water useage by 1/3 by 2020 (this isn’t true). I’d like to create a calculator letting users see how they could save water for California. There would be a bunch of options that show users how much water each would save, but also how much it would cost. Everything from making it illegal for people to water their grass, to building a desalinization plant to use water from the sea.</p>

    <p>Next Tuesday we will not have class. I’ll be out of the country. But, you will need to email me a link to your progress on your final project. I’ll remind you the day before. Your site doesn’t have to be done, but it should be underway. It’s due on our last class, May 10. Then, you’ll present it.</p>
    <p>Here are more ideas. Mostly journalism-y things because that’s what I like, but don’t limit yourself.</p>

Guys, we're getting into the heavy stuff. JavaScript. Making it dance. The big show. Really, though, all we did was add a little bit of JavaScript to our page. Basically, we added a simple function that amounts to "click this button and do something."

##Remember how we did it?

We added two `<script> </script>` tags just before the closing `</body>` tag in `index.html`. The first included a JavaScript library called [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/) â€” basically a bundle of code some lovely people wrote for us to make our lives easier. The second linked to our own js file `script.js`. It looked like this.

{% highlight html linenos%}
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="script.js"></script>

</body>
{% endhighlight %}

Here's what `script.js` contained.

{% highlight js linenos%}
// the first line selects the button and waits for a click
// when the button is clicked it runs a function 
// that selects the h1 and does something

$("button").click(function(){
  $("h1").doSomething();
});
{% endhighlight %}

This is just a few lines of js, but it's pretty powerful. Click a button and do something is a fundamental piece of the internet. Don't underestimate this lil code snippet.

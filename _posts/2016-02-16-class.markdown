we actually coded up a website. remember the steps.

1. create your repo.
2. clone your repo.
3. sketch your site and markup. diagram your site, what elements should be what tags?
4. set up your files. (create an index file, a css folder and a style.css file)
5. open your folder in sublime and start coding. you'll need to link up your css file in your `<head>` tag of your `index.html` file, download a reset stylesheet from [here](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css), link that up in your `<head>` tag, add your markup for your site, and add some style. 
6. save your project periodically, open it in your browser, and refresh to check your changes.
7. once you're ready to, push up your project to github. 
8. in iterm, cd into your project folder, then add your files (`git add .`), commit them (`git commit -m "message here"`), and push them to the master branch (`git push origin master`).
9. to make them live, create a gh-pages branch (`git branch gh-pages`) switch to the gh-pages branch (`git checkout gh-pages`) and push to the gh-pages branch (`git push origin gh-pages`). 
10. check `http://your-github-username.github.io/repo-name` to see your project live.

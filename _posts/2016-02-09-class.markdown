description: HTML, CSS, command line, Github. What? Youâ€™ll have a site published on the internet by the end of class.
assignment: a2. Create a repo called <code>a2-repo</code>, add a bit of code, and get it live on your github pages url
---
open iterm

navigate to your `web-fundamentals` folder (remember you'll have to cd to do this)

open github in chrome

create a new repository

name it `a2-repo`

copy the link it gives you after you create it

go back to iterm

type `git clone` then paste in that link

this clones the repo

cd into the repo

type `touch index.html` 

to create your index file

open the folder in sublime

add some code

save and preview it in chrome (right click and choose `open in browser`)

go back to iterm

type `git add index.html`

`git commit -m "your message here"`

`git push origin master`

this adds it to your github profile, but now we have to make a branch to make it live

type `git branch gh-pages` 
  
to create the brach

`git checkout gh-pages`

to change to the branch

`git merge master`

to merge the master branch

`git push origin gh-pages`

to push it up

`git checkout master`

to move back to our master branch

check http://your-github-usernmae.github.io/a2repo

rejoice (or cry)

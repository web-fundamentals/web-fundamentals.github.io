## come up with an idea for a quiz. 
there are a bunch of examples below to get you started.

sketch on paper (or photoshop or illustrator) your wireframe for how you want the quiz to look. 
show it to me.

gather the elements you need. 
write your questions. 

translate your sketch into html.
add style.
add js.

publish! before the next class. both of you need to publish your own to your own github, but the code can be the same.
